This is terrible! The town is in ruins! Everyone has fled!

What's a mayor to do...

You there! You're responsible for this! The least you can do is help me.

There's so much that needs to be done just to get everything back in order.

|Talk to people around town. Help them out, we can't do this unless we all work together.

Will you help us?

It's going to be tough work, but if we all work together to get things back to normal, we might even be able to pull it off before the annual fair.
