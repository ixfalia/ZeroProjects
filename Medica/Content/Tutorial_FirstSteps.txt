'Left Click' is used to navigate menus and the interface. 

|Try pressing the menu buttons at the bottom of the screen, for useful information.

* The Inventory Menu shows what you currently have in your inventory.
* The Journal Menu keeps entries for all of the things you've seen so far.

|You'll probably find more people who look a lot like me. Often, they'll have exclamation points over their heads.

Most of these people are in need of something and will make a request of you. Try to find the items they need to help them and they may reward you for your efforts.
