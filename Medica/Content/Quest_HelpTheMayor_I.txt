This is terrible! The town is in ruins! Everyone has fled!

What's a mayor to do...

You there! You're responsible for this! The least you can do is help me.

The Annual Town fair is in 3 weeks, we need to give the townspeople something to be happy about again.

|It's going to be tough work, but if we all work together to get things back to normal, we might be able to pull it off.

The more we fix, the more the towns people will come back. 

By the time the fair rolls around, if enough people come back, it will be quite the celebration.

Here's what we'll need to do.

|We should get the symbol of our town back. Before the disaster, we had a great statue in the center of town. It represented our town. Maybe people's hope will come back if we rebuild it.

The sculptor that originally made it is a recluse, however. A long time ago, he moved into the woods because of a feud.

Go see him and see if you can get him to begin work on a new statue.
