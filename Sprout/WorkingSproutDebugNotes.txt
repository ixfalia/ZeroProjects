Sprout Debugging Ideas

(fixed) Sprout Placing Broken (CHECK!)
    #= Go through all components in redFlower/sproutSeed and see if any of them could block messages
    #= Bypass UIButton altogether for Sprout
    #= Look up resources for mouse events
    #= Change Build Version to see if that fixes things. 
	(Solution) HUD captures mouse clicks, sends an event, and Sprouts Listen for it, the Sprout that the mouse is hovering over is the one that responds. 

(Fixed) On Game Over Sprout Text still Visible (Possibly fixed now)
    = Look into making Sprout text invisible using the onGameOver event

Random Fast EndingMusic Played!?
    = Bug? or Feature?
	(causes) if the pitch is tuned up because a combo chain is occuring on the end of the turn it recreates it.
	= Possible solution is to move the EndLevel sound logic code in SoundManage.py above the pitch adapting code. Since it has a return it will end.
	= but I almost want to leave it in as a funny quirk
	
Rotator snaps and doesn't smoothly change directions

(possibly fixed?) RainbowFlower is white at first

(posibly fixed?) Rainbow Flower doesn't always display particle effect when it's next to be planted

Bloom Chains on the last turn don't disappear

(Fixed) = Effect Chain (the line up of the next seeds) slowly drifts to the left if you place sprouts too fast, in particular the last one and first one =
	(solution) = added variable to track original position of all the objects, and another to track the big tracking flower.
	
Bloomed Flowers are distorted in scale somewhate
	= It's likely that when scalerator is turned off it's not setting it back to the original settings
	(solution) revert back to original scale when it blooms
