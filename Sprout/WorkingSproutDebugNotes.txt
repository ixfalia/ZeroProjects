Sprout Debugging IDeas
    = Go through all components in redFlower/sproutSeed and see if any of them could block messages
    = Bypass UIButton altogether for Sprout
    = Look up resources for mouse events
//    = Change Build Version to see if that fixes things. 
	= UIButton activation behavior is lost on the level change, the same object in the tutorial level cannot be clicked in another
		= Find out the Source of this. Note the different objects in the levels
		= See level settings I might be missing
		= See the components that might cause this
		
		+ the loading of the UIHUD level seems to be causing this. It may be that it is taking up mouseclicks. Not sure how to solve
		+ Part of why Sprouts don't detect behavior to plant is that self.GameOver is set to true upon the Level Start via an event for some reason, unfortunately I have no idea why I did it this way
		+ game works! if I disable hud, but cannot be ended.
